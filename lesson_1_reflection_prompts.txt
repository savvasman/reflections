111How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

    
- I can see which lines where removed, altered or added!
(Μπορώ να δω γραμμες, κλπ)


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?


- Make radical changes, with no risk!
(Κάνω ριζικές αλλαγές...)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


- I can choose logical steps to be commited!


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?





How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?





Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- Try to keep to more versions of code maybe, although it would be stupid.
